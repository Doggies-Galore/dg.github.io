    <h1>Hybrid Game Console</h1>
    <h3>Summer 2017</p>
    <h2>I came up with the idea to create a portable Hybrid Game Console using a Raspberry Pi, LCD, and Battery. Me and my dad bought plexiglass for the housing, and designed button PCBs for Arduinos to act as a USB input device. We kept an HDMI output so that users could play on an external display, or on the internal display.</h2>
