    <h1>Programming AIBO</h1>
    <h3>Summer 2019</p>
    <h2>AIBO is Sony's robotic dog. Using programming tools that are older than I am, I learned RCode and scripted an app that allows AIBO to grow form a "puppy" to an "adult" by tracking its experiences and learning over time. Depending on interactions (and an element of random chance) AIBO will develop into a unique personality. This was the first project I did entirely independently.</h2>
