    <h1>Polarized Arcade</h1>
    <h3>Summer 2018</p>
    <h2>Using an old Microsoft Surface, Retroarch, a broken monitor, and an arcade controller set, I designed and helped assemble an arcade cabinet made of MDF that housed the Surface, hidden behind a display that required polarizing glasses. This meant that only users wearing the glasses could see the display.</h2>
